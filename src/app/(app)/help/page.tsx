  {
    question: "How do I book a new job?",
    answer:
      "Go to Bookings and click \"New booking\". Fill in the customer, job type, date and an optional estimated price — a linked job card is created automatically on the Job Cards board.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between an estimate and an invoice?",
    answer:
      "An estimate is a quote sent before work is confirmed. From the Estimates & Invoicing page click \"New estimate\", and once the customer approves it, open the estimate and click \"Convert to Invoice\".",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I mark a part as low stock?",
    answer:
      "Low stock is automatic — a part shows a \"Reorder now\" badge on the Inventory page whenever its stock level drops to or below its reorder level, which you set when adding or editing the part.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I change my garage's details on invoices?",
    answer:
      "Yes — go to Settings and update your garage name, address, VAT number and default VAT rate. These are used across new estimates and invoices.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do reminders work?",
    answer:
      "Reminders are simple follow-ups you set yourself (e.g. \"Call customer about MOT\"), optionally linked to a customer. They show as overdue once their due date passes, and you can tick them off from the Reminders page.",
  },
